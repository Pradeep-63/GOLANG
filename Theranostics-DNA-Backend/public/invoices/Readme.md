# Invoices PDF Files

## Overview

The `invoices` folder is a dedicated storage location for generated PDF invoices. Each time a customer completes a transaction, an invoice PDF is created and saved here for easy access, download, and future reference.

## Importance

1. **Centralized Storage**: 
   - This folder keeps all invoice files organized in one place, making it easier for both developers and administrators to locate and manage invoices.

2. **Efficient Retrieval**:
   - Having a single directory for all PDF invoices allows for faster retrieval and easier integration with other services, such as email dispatch for sending invoices to customers.

3. **User Access**:
   - The files in this folder can be used to provide download links to users, allowing them to access and retain records of their purchases.

4. **Compliance and Record-Keeping**:
   - Invoices serve as a formal record of transactions, which can be essential for tax reporting, auditing, and compliance purposes.

5. **Enhanced Customer Experience**:
   - By offering downloadable invoices, we improve the transparency and professionalism of our service, giving customers a reliable way to verify their purchases.

## Folder Structure

Each invoice PDF is typically named using a unique identifier (such as the invoice ID or transaction ID) to prevent conflicts and ensure quick retrieval. The folder structure can be organized by:
- **Date**: Separate folders for each month or year.
- **Customer ID**: Group invoices by customer for easier customer-based searching.

## Access and Security

To maintain data integrity and security:
- Ensure that this folder is not publicly accessible in production environments.
- Only authorized personnel or systems should have access to this folder.
  
Consider configuring server permissions or adding authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
